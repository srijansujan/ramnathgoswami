<p><strong>Address :</strong> Village : Agarbandh, P.O. : Hoomgarh, District : West Midnapore</p>

<p align="justify"> From a remote village near Garbeta in West Midnapore, Ramnath lost his father at a very early age. Since then his mother has been toiling hard, doing menial jobs to feed the family. The family has no fixed income. Poverty and misfortune notwithstanding Ramnath stood first in his school in the Higher Secondary Examinations, securing 82.8%. Following which he got admitted to Garbeta College for a bachelorâ€™s in English in 2015. Unfortunately, Ramnath could not appear for his first year exams in 2016 as he was struck by severe nerve problems and he had to repeat the year. Srijan Sujan promises to stand by him in this phase of his academic journey. </p>
